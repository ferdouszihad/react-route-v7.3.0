# React Router _V7.3.0_

React Router is a powerful routing library for React applications. The latest version, _V7.3.0_

For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Let's understand the Concept of Routing

Routing is the process of determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) . In the context of React applications, routing allows you to navigate between different components or views, enabling a single-page application (SPA) experience. React Router provides a declarative way to define routes and manage navigation, making it easier to build dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Let's Start React Router

1. Go to the [official documentation](https://reactrouter.com/) > Docs
2. You will see 3 Mode.
   - Declarative Mode
   - Data Mode
   - Framework Mode

You have to choose your mode based on how will you use react-router. We suggest you to read the complete overview of each mode from this link https://reactrouter.com/start/modes

# Explore React Router ( Declarative Mode)

⚠️ I Hope that you allready read the [docs](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes) for picking a mode

if you need basic routing features like

- Simply navigating around the app
- Routes based simple component rendering with \< Link >, useNavigate, and useLocation
- matching URLs to components then render using **Outlet** , _useParams()_

Then the declarative mode will be great choice for you. if you came here to learn **react-router** then starting with declarative mode will be a great choice.

## Install React Router ( Declarative Mode )

```bash
React Router v7 requires the following minimum versions:

- node@20
- react@18
- react-dom@18
# upgrade your node version , react version , react-dom version if you dont have this set up
```

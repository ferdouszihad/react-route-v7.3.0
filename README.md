# React Router _V7.3.0_

React Router is a powerful routing library for React applications. The latest version, _V7.3.0_

For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Let's understand the Concept of Routing

Routing is the process of determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) . In the context of React applications, routing allows you to navigate between different components or views, enabling a single-page application (SPA) experience. React Router provides a declarative way to define routes and manage navigation, making it easier to build dynamic and responsive web applications.
